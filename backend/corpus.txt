Title: Introduction to Python and Programming Mindset
Alright everyone, good morning. Before we even write our first line of Python code, I want you to understand how a programmer thinks. When I say Python is an interpreted language, what I really mean in practical terms is that you can experiment very quickly. Indentation in Python is not cosmetic. It defines blocks of logic and improves readability.
